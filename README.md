# Simple FiveM Backdoor Idea

⚠️ This code serves solely for educational purposes, is poorly written, and merely aims to demonstrate how simple it is.

# Instructions

The code is hidden as a part of a medical menu. You "could" rename the variables into everything else.

1. Put it in any server-side lua of your target resource.
2. Put in your .txt URL which contains your code into the "healthData" var.
3. Form it in ASCII.
4. If the resource is started, any client can execute the code of the .txt URL with:
   /applyskin


# Warning
This is just a simple example. Developers can easily detect the backdoor and its obv. not obfuscated.
(That can be made by you)

It's just hidden. :)
